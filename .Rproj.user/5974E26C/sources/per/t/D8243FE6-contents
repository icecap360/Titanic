#various functions to read spreadsheets from readr in tidyverse
  #read_table, read_csv, read_csv2, read_tsv, read_delim
  #for whitespace txt, comma csv, semicolon csv, tab tsv, txt files respectively
  #according to stackoverflow use readxl library and read_excel read_excel("my-spreadsheet.xls", sheet = "data")
  #read_excel to autodetect or read_xls/read_xslsx for original/newformat,
      #as well these allow u to read multiple tables in each file (called sheet)
        #get names of sheets by excel_sheets
#read_lines to see first few lines of file, useful for finding if header of file
#head(dat) we recognize that these functions return tibbles 

#Example of reading files
# file.location <- file.path(system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs"), "murders.csv")
# file.destination <- file.path(getwd(), "data")
# file.copy(file.location, file.destination) 

#base Rfunctions, have read. instead of read_
#read.table, read.csv, read.delim
dat2 <- read.csv(filename)
#main difference is now you have dataframce , characters become factors, to avoid set stringAsfactors=FALSE
#read_csv(url), read_csv("times.txt", col_names = TRUE)
#downlaod.file(url, "muderers.csv") to make local copy
#tempdir and tempfile() fo create unlikely file name 
#There is no header. The col_names=FALSE argument is necessary

# tmp_filename <- tempfile()
# download.file(url, tmp_filename)
# dat <- read_csv(tmp_filename)
# file.remove(tmp_filename)
