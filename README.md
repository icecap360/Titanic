# TITANIC
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Technologies used: 
* R
* Various packages within R 

## Modelling
To build models. The focus was on variants of linear regression such as lasso regression, ridge regression and logistic regression, but my sucess came from 
using conclusion in the initial data exploration to infer possible interaction, polynomial, and step functions terms. Anova tables and coefficient pvalues were used to filter 
features and asses models. Support vector machines (with linear, polynomial, and gaussian kernels), tree based models such as random forests, and smoothing linear regression were all attempted but gave mediocre unsucessful.

In the end, lasso regression with higher order interaction and polynomial terms was the best model. These higher order terms were selected from insight in the exploration section and trial/error.

Directories:
Data: Contains scripts to preprocess raw data
Exploration: Exploring the data, including hypothesis testing but primarily graphs. Only important discoveries are reported and proved in the script.
Figures: Graphs from which conclusions were drawn (generated by the Exploration script)
Model: Trying various models, using MSE as the metric
FinalModel: Tunes the best model architecture (in this case lasso regression) and generates the predictions csv.
